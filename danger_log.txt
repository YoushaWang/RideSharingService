1. Login/Logout
a. Username is unique for our app.
b. Users can edit first name, last name, password for account.
c. If the driver doesn't enter the vehicle's information, he can still be a driver.

2. Ride Request
Special Information: When sharer information is added, need to update the total
customer number.


3. Driver
a. When a ride is searched by driver, only ride with the customer number
less than capacity can be searched.
b. Driver can see his own order and can confirm the ride requested by himself
c. If a driver choose to become a normal user,
the ride which he wants to be a driver will not automatically become OPEN.
d. The way we used to relate sharer and driver is simply finding the username
instead of a many-to-many relationship, which is not such professional.
e. When a driver choose to be a normal user, his car information will not
be deleted automatically. Instead, we keep that information, which is convenient
for the user.


4. Rider & sharer
a. one ride can only be shared by one person
b. sharer cannot share the ride requested/owned by himself
c. Confirmed ride cannot be shown in the rider's page
d. Only the destination, special information, sharer number of a ride can be
edited by a sharer, which is more appropriate


5. Database problem
If the data-base is very huge, it is hard to find a order.

NEED IMPROVE:
1. open ride edit need to show default value
2. find share ride - no pickup place - although requirement 14 doesn't require this
3. search share -(capacity ? 20's limit shi bu shi tai da le) and the earliest and lateset prefer to be at diff row
